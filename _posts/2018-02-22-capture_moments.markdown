Past few weeks have been more difficult to me than the 1st few weeks to get on track due to my current job. Here I am taking this course slowly, but surely. This year flew by so fast. Last month I made a life changing decision to start learning how to code. Next thing I knew, I just coded an entire Tic-Tac-Toe lab by myself. 

Past few days, I got a chance to solve some labs on CodinGame. There are many different labs and languages that you can improve your coding skill through this website. I am looking for ways to keep improving my skills and I wish one day I will be able to create a website like CodinGame.
