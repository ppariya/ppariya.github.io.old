There are few times that I need to go back and review the content since everthing is new to me. There are some topics that it was so easy and are some that I have harder time to understand. 

Array Iterators are the main one that I have harder time to apply my knowledge. I do not know I could use it in a certain way until google it. Google is my best friend for this topic. However, as I have progressed through the course it becomes a little bit easier. 

These are some website that I use:

* https://stackoverflow.com/
* https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/
* http://ruby-doc.org/core-1.9.3/
