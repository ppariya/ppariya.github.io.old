My journey began since Freshman year of college. I originally majored in Computer Science. However, I did not have a good experience to begin with. Everytime I went to my Java professor's office hours, she always tried to 'kick me out' of her office because she was too busy studying to obtain her Doctorate degree. I did not feel like this is a good department to be a part of so I changed my major to Food Science and now I am a QA Coordinator at Snyder's-Lance in food manufacturing. 


My passion of coding is still hiding somewhere inside me. Everytime I go to the bookstore, the programming section is always my 'go to' section. I like to ask my boy friend, who is a software developer, about what he does. I love to solve puzzles and coding is like solving a puzzle to me especially with test-driven development. Recently, I found myself becoming curious and want to get back into coding more and more. I found Flatrion School one day and saw they offer a free bootcamp program. I gave it a try and told myself if I actually enjoy it and am passionate about this after I go through this free bootcamp, then I will actually consider changing my career path. Changing a career path is not an easy decision to make for me. I had to make sure that is what I really want and am passionate about. 


Well.....here I am. You probably already know the answer of my decision. I am really looking forward to my journey to become a web developer. I do want to see how much I can learn and how far I can go in this new journey.
